## Deployment Steps

### 1. For Vercel Deployment:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` = `production`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAIL` = `ayushsao32@gmail.com`  
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` = `password`

### 2. For Netlify Deployment:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Build command: `npm run build`
3. Publish directory: `.next`
4. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard (same as above)

### 3. For Railway/Heroku:
1. Add environment variables to your platform
2. Ensure build command is set to `npm run build`
3. Start command should be `npm start`

## Troubleshooting Online Login Issues

### Common Issues:
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are set in your hosting platform
2. **Build Process**: Make sure the build completes without errors
3. **Client-Side Hydration**: The new code handles SSR/hydration issues
4. **localStorage**: Now properly handled for server-side rendering

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12) on your live site
2. Check Console for error messages
3. Try clearing browser cache/localStorage
4. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

### If Login Still Fails:
1. Check browser console for detailed debug logs
2. Verify the exact error message
3. Test with different browsers
4. Check if the hosting platform supports client-side JavaScript

## Testing Locally:
```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build
npm start
# Then test login on http://localhost:3000
```
